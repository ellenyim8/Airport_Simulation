# Airport_Simulation

A simple, but sophisticated simulation providing insights into plane arrivals and logistics. 

* Small simulation program for a small airport with one runway.
* Runway can occupy one plane at a time. 

###### Assumptions:
- all takeoffs occupy the same amount of time <br> 
- all landings occupy the same amount of time (does not need to be same as takeoff time) <br> 
- all planes arrive for landing at random times but with specified probability arriving during any given minute
- all planes arrive at takeoff queue at random times, but a (possibly different) specified probabilty of departure (delay makes this a reasonable assumption) <br> 
- landings will have priority over takeoffs
